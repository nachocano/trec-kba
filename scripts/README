README

In the treckba repo, inside java folder, assembly the jar with all the dependencies (needs java 7)

  mvn assembly:single

This will generate a jar named treckba-with-dependencies.jar inside target folder.

Download the pre trained Google embeddings file.

Unzip it.

Install gensim 
pip install --upgrade gensim

In the scripts folder, there should be a file called visualization_gen.py. You should execute that passing different params in order to generate the json output for the visualization.
Example:

python visualization_gen.py -ri ../../sameer/nigeria_dataset_v04.staleness.txt -e ../../data/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin -o ../../sameer/nigeria_dataset_v04.staleness.values.txt -j ../java/target/treckba-jar-with-dependencies.jar -a 0.2 -gd 1 -gi 0.1

-ri = raw input file, with the words instead of the embeddings
-ei = optional, file with the embeddings computed from the raw input file. If provided, it does not compute the embeddings again, it just uses this file.
-e = GoogleNews bin file with the pre trained embeddings
-o = json output file
-j = treckba-with-dependencies.jar file assembled before
-a = alpha
-gd = gamma decrease
-gi = gamma increase
-c = optional. Time normalizing constant. Default 86400 (seconds in a day)

NOTE: Loading the google bin file takes around ~3 min and makes stuff a little slow.
